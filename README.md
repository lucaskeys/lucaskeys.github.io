# _PDX Thread Count Sample Homepage_

_Sample responsive landing page for PDX Threadcount idea._

_**Luke Keysboe**_

## Description

Portland holds a good size scene for males fashion and Portland prides itself of a city full of local misc. stores, bars, restaurants, entertainment, etc. For most of these â€‹industries in Portland, dedicated websites already exist (e.i: Thrillest for Food, Portland Mercury: Music, Portland Monthly: Eat and drink, and general fashion shopping). Portland does not yet have a dedicated platform for Mens fashion. Currently, when googling mens clothing in Portland, results are lacking, and only big box stores along with yelp are the top results.

PDX Threadcount will act as a site and phone app where users can connect with stores, receive updates on store news, news releases, and sales
